# Comparison

This page says what `two-key-concept` decides, and what it does not. It is
not a ranking and it has no scores. The other rows are categories people
already search for when they want to stop an agent from acting. Confirm the
current behavior of those projects in their own docs before you rely on them.

A call runs only if Path A and Path B both allow, and only if the gateway
later redeems a single-use token bound to that tool and those argument
bytes. Path A does not read English. There is no MCP server in this release.
There are no scanner hooks in this package.

| Category | What that category decides | This package |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Content and injection filters, such as Llama Guard, Prompt Guard, NeMo input rails, and Guardrails AI | Whether text looks unsafe, off-topic, or injected | Does not. Path A never reads the proposal. A filter can run before this package. It is not the authorization decision. |
| Dialogue and execution rails, such as NeMo execution rails | Whether a step in a conversation script may call a tool | Does not model a dialogue. The gateway runs a registered function only after both paths allow and the token matches the argument bytes. |
| Deterministic policy engines, such as Cedar, OPA, and Cerbos | Whether a request is permitted by policy, independent of a model | Path A is this kind of check, and only for the normalized action record and the compiled hard rules. It is not a general policy engine for the rest of the application. The second key is the judge quorum. The token and the ledger are part of the decision. |
| Identity and MCP transport authorization | Whether a client may open a session or act as a user | Not an MCP server, and not user login. This package has no X.509 or PKI check. |
| Audit products and DLP | Whether a payload is sensitive, and whether an outside system stores the decision | The ledger is an encrypted hash chain with a signed head. Nothing is exported to a SIEM. There is no DLP or antivirus hook, and no built-in scan of argument text. |

## Do not use this instead of

- a content filter or a moderation API
- user login, OAuth for your users, or MCP session authorization
- a hosted DLP or antivirus product
- a FIPS 140-3 validated module

Path A is only as good as the structured fields it is given. With
`tool_specs` in the signed constitution, those fields are derived from the
argument bytes and a disagreeing claim is a deny. Without `tool_specs`, who
produces the record is still open. See [THREAT_MODEL.md](THREAT_MODEL.md).
This package does not classify free text and does not track per-value
information flow. The package that adds scanning, PKI, and anchoring is
[two-key](https://github.com/Insomniac-VibeLabs/two-key).
What this repository leaves out is [SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md).
