# How to run the concept

Whether this package is the right control is [FIT.md](FIT.md). What it is
not a substitute for is [COMPARISON.md](COMPARISON.md). Boundaries and
residual risk are [THREAT_MODEL.md](THREAT_MODEL.md). What this package
leaves out is [SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md).

Commands are from the repository root.

## Install

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[yaml]"
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Create a principal key and sign a constitution

```bash
python -m two_key init-key ./keys
python -m two_key sign-constitution \
  --key ./keys/principal.pem \
  --prose examples/constitution.md \
  --rules examples/hard_rules.yaml \
  --out constitution.signed.json
```

`init-key` writes `principal.pem` with mode 0600 (created that way, never
chmodded afterwards) and refuses to overwrite an existing key. Commands that
take `--key` refuse a key file that the group or others can read
(`key_file_insecure`) or that is a symlink.

The signature covers the prose, the hard rules, and `tool_specs`. A modified
file will not load. `tool_specs` is required. A bare rule list, a missing
key, `null`, and an empty mapping are refused. `examples/hard_rules.yaml`
has a spec for every allow-listed tool. Amount, counterparty, and
irreversible are read from the argument bytes, and a claim that disagrees
is a deny. `data_class` is the stricter of the claim and the tool's
`data_class_floor`. This package does not classify free text. A tool that
carries text the rules must treat as sensitive needs that class as its
`data_class_floor`. A missing amount path, a non-numeric amount, or a
currency other than `usd` on `pay_bill` is a deny. A value that cannot be
read at all is a `derive_failed` deny: `derive_failed:amount_unreadable`
for an amount such as `10**400`, `derive_failed:value_unreadable:<type_tag>` for
any other value (type label via `type_tag`, ≤32 chars; never raw `__name__`).

A key the spec does not name does not change the form and does not reach
the tool. The spec does not have to list every nested key. `deny_unmapped`
defaults off: the call can still allow, and the gateway drops the unnamed
key. The ledger records the names of dropped keys (`dropped_keys`), never
their values. Set it true to deny that key (`unmapped_field`). `payload`
names a value that may be present and is not interpreted. A payload path
may not equal, contain, or sit under an amount, currency, or counterparty
path, compared without regard to case (`TO.name` overlaps `to.name`);
such a spec does not load. With no `shape`, that
path covers the value and its children. `shape` is optional: `string`,
`number`, or `list` (a list of strings). `max_length` bounds a string or
a list. A nested value, a boolean, or a too-long value is
`payload_shape`. Shape does not read the contents. Classification of what
the text means is left to Path B, or to DLP outside this package.

A counterparty path must include `allow`, a non-empty list of strings. A
party that is not on that list is `counterparty_not_allowed`. The tool
receives the canonical party (trimmed, lower case), not the raw spelling.
`examples/hard_rules.yaml` allows `ada@example` on the mail tools and
`power-co.example` on `pay_bill`. Those mail tools name `subject` and
`body` as strings (`max_length` 200 and 8000). The words are not read. A
field that is neither a control path nor a payload path is dropped. A
blocked party still denies through `deny_counterparties` when one is present.

Missing `data_class` still defaults to `classified` before the floor, and
a floor never lowers that. Missing `irreversible` follows the tool spec,
so a reversible tool stays reversible. A present claim that disagrees with
the spec is a deny. Pass `--data-class public` only when that class is
allowed after the floor, and pass `--no-irreversible` only for a tool the
spec marks reversible.

## Judges

`examples/judges.yaml` is the hook list: OpenAI-compatible (OpenAI and xAI),
Anthropic, Gemini, and Ollama. No vendor SDK is used. Each thread keeps one
connection per origin and does not follow redirects.

Cloud OpenAI and xAI send a strict ballot schema. xAI also sends
`reasoning_effort: low`. A single HTTP 400 drops those knobs and retries
once. The local ballot parser does not change on that retry. Any other
HTTP error abstains.

## The monitored agent and the judge-is-not-the-agent rule

The minimum is one judge, and no judge may be the monitored agent. A judge
may run any model from any vendor. A judge must not be the monitored agent:
`TwoKey` refuses to start (`judge_matches_agent:`) when a judge holds the
monitored agent's credential (the same API token, or the same username and
password), at any address, or when neither side sends a credential on the
same address. You declare who the agent is; Two-Key refuses a judge that is
the agent, and makes likely accidents visible rather than blocking them.

Declare the agent yourself, never from what the agent reports: the
`monitored_agent:` block in judges.yaml (the CLI reads it), or
`TwoKey(monitored_agent=...)` with a mapping, an `AgentDeclaration`, a
`MonitoredAgent`, or a list of them. Give `model`, `provider` (a label,
recorded and never compared), `base_url`, and exactly one credential:
`credential_env` (the name of the environment variable holding the agent's
API token), `username_env` with `password_env` (the names of the two
variables holding a username and password, sent as HTTP Basic over HTTPS
only), or `credential: none` for a keyless loopback or private agent.
Optional keys are `id`, `tenant`, and `upstream`; any other key is refused.
Without a declaration, `TwoKey` refuses with `monitored_agent_required:`.

At startup each judge and agent is resolved to:

- a normalized model id: NFKC first, Unicode dashes folded to `-`,
  zero-width characters removed, lower case, then router prefixes, dated
  snapshot suffixes, `-latest`, Vertex `@` versions, Bedrock `-v2:0`,
  Ollama `:latest`, Azure's `gpt-35`, and a few aliases removed or mapped;
- the endpoint `host:port` of `base_url`. Every name or address of this
  machine is written `localhost`: loopback names and addresses (including
  `127.1`), `localhost.localdomain`, `0.0.0.0` and `::`, and the machine's
  own host name and addresses. Other hosts are compared literally by
  `host:port`;
- the upstream that serves the model, and how it was found
  (`resolved_by`): `endpoint` (a direct provider host, Azure OpenAI, or a
  known inference host), `model_prefix` (a recognized router, a local
  server, or an unknown host where the model id names its maker, such as
  `openai/gpt-4o` or `qwen2.5:7b`), or `declared_upstream` (your
  `upstream:` key). `model_prefix` is operator-attested through the model
  name and is not verified. A model id ending in `:cloud` or `-cloud`
  adds `ollama.com` and is never local;
- tenant ids, each scoped by provider family: the Azure resource and
  deployment and the Vertex project read from the URL, plus a `tenant:`
  mapping you declare with any of `organization`, `project`, `account`,
  and `deployment` (for example `tenant: {organization: org-123}`). A
  Bedrock `account` is scoped by the region in the host. Elsewhere a
  declared id is scoped by the provider family: the endpoint's (`openai`,
  `anthropic`, `ollama`, ...), or for a proxy on a local or unrecognized
  host the family of its declared `upstream:`, its Ollama cloud model, or
  its model maker, never the proxy's own address. So `project: p1` behind a
  local proxy to OpenAI is the same tenant as `project: p1` at
  api.openai.com;
- a credential fingerprint of the key with surrounding whitespace stripped,
  under a per-install key, `<ledger>.ledger-key/fingerprint.key` (32 random
  bytes, created once with O_EXCL, mode 0600): HMAC-SHA256 for an API token
  (`hmac-sha256:`), and scrypt (N=2^17, r=8, p=1: 128 MiB, about 0.4 s;
  `scrypt-n17-r8-p1:`) for a username and password, fingerprinted as one
  `username:password` pair with whitespace stripped from its two ends only.
  The key sits beside the ledger key, so it does not stop someone who holds
  that directory; there a random token is safe by its length, a guessable
  token (a placeholder such as `EMPTY`) is not, and a password is protected
  only by scrypt's cost. A fingerprint is chosen by content: any secret that
  contains `:` is fingerprinted as a `username:password` pair with scrypt,
  never with HMAC, so a judge or agent holding a username and password as a
  token (`user:pass` in `credential_env`) matches the other side's Basic
  pair, and a password never gets the cheap hash. Raw keys and passwords are
  never logged.

`TwoKey` refuses with `judge_matches_agent:` only when a judge is the
monitored agent. That is either of these:

- the same credential, at any address: the same API token or the same
  username and password (as fingerprints, whitespace stripped from the ends
  of the token or of the `username:password` pair). A credential
  identifies its holder wherever it is sent, so a judge with the agent's key
  behind a pass-through proxy, under another name for the agent's server, or
  at a provider's alternate host is still the agent. Every credential either
  side holds counts, whether or not its connector sends it: a judge with
  `auth_header: none` (an Ollama judge's default) that is configured with
  the agent's key, and an `agents.yaml` `ollama` agent whose configured key
  a judge also holds, are refused. The ledger records every credential a
  side holds under `credential_fingerprint`, and whether it is sent under
  `credential_sent`. A placeholder that a
  local server ignores (`EMPTY`) counts too: give each side its own value,
  or leave it off one side (`auth: {type: none}` on a judge,
  `credential: none` on the agent). On one shared server that ignores keys,
  different placeholders only hide that both sides are keyless there: give
  the judge its own server or port instead;
- no credential on either side, on the same address: the same endpoint
  `host:port` as above, with every alias of this machine folded to
  `localhost`. Two keyless sides on one address, such as two models on one
  local Ollama daemon, have nothing to tell them apart, so they are refused
  whatever their models. Give the judge its own daemon or port, or its own
  credential. For this address rule only, a connector Two-Key drives counts
  as keyless when it sends no credential, whatever is configured: a judge
  with `auth_header: none` (an Ollama judge's default) and an `agents.yaml`
  `ollama` agent without Basic auth send none. Two-Key sees only what its
  own connectors send: a `monitored_agent:` declaration with
  `credential_env` or `username_env` counts as keyed even when its server
  ignores the key (an Ollama daemon), so a keyless judge on that address
  only warns (`same_address_one_side_keyless`). Declare such an agent with
  `credential: none`. Addresses are compared as you configure them; DNS
  names are not resolved.

Everything else starts: any model, any vendor, any route, the same provider,
the same model through another endpoint, and the same address with a
different credential. Likely accidents still start, but each prints a
`two-key: WARNING: judge '<j>' vs agent '<a>': ...` line on stderr and is
recorded in `constitution_loaded` under `judge_agent_separation.warnings`
(agent, judge, `check`, detail):

| `check` | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| `same_address_one_side_keyless` | The same address, and only one side has a credential (a daemon may ignore it) |
| `same_model_same_address` | The same normalized model on the same address, with a different credential |
| `same_model_shared_route` | The same model reaching a shared route: a declared `upstream:`, the endpoint, or `ollama.com` for a `-cloud` model |
| `same_model_unknown_proxy` | The same model through a loopback, private, or unrecognized proxy or daemon with no declared `upstream:`, which could forward to the agent's own account |
| `shared_tenant` | A shared tenant id (an Azure resource or deployment, a Vertex project, a Bedrock account and region, or a declared id) |
| `unresolved_identity` | An upstream that cannot be resolved (an unrecognized router or host, or a local proxy serving an alias model); declare `upstream:` to attest it |

`upstream:` and `tenant:` are recorded and not verified. They only change
which warnings print. `allow_same_provider_judge` and
`allow_same_model_distinct_tenant` are accepted, print a deprecation note,
are recorded in `quorum_policy` (and so in `policy_digest`), and have no
effect: nothing they used to lift is refused any more. A misspelled quorum
key is still refused as `unknown quorum keys`.

Judge and agent credentials are read at startup for this check, so a
configured key that cannot be read refuses to start, for a local agent as
well as a cloud one, and also when its connector never sends it (an
`agents.yaml` `ollama` agent without Basic auth, or a judge with
`auth_header: none`): Two-Key cannot show it differs from the agent's. The result is the `judge_agent_separation`
field of the `constitution_loaded` ledger entry: every resolved identity
(fingerprints only), the fingerprint scheme and key id, and
`identities_digest`. The entry also holds the full quorum policy
(`quorum_policy`) and its `policy_digest`. Each `decision` entry carries
`identities_digest` and `policy_digest`, not the full policy. To check
them, `two_key.audit.check_decision_digests(ledger)` recomputes both from
the latest `constitution_loaded` before each decision and returns a list of
mismatches (empty when all match). By hand: `identities_digest` is
`canonical_hash({"agents": sep["agents"], "judges": sep["judges"]})` and
`policy_digest` is `canonical_hash(quorum_policy)`, with `canonical_hash`
from `two_key.canonical` (SHA-256 of sorted-key, compact, ASCII JSON).

At call time, a judge that is not on a loopback host makes the round deny
when `authorize` gets no `agent_session` (`cloud_judge_session_required`).
A judge whose credential equals that session (whitespace stripped, a
username and password compared as their pair, a key it holds but never
sends included) abstains with
`cloud_judge_reused_agent_session`, wherever it connects, and the round
denies. This is the start-up rule again, at call time, with the session the
agent really uses: it catches a judge holding the agent's key even when
`monitored_agent:` names the wrong key or address.

The in-process placeholder agent `two_key.testing.TEST_AGENT` is accepted
only with `allow_test_doubles=True` and only when every judge is a test
double (`in_process_agent_refused`).

## Quorum policy

The default needs one judge and has no diversity floors: `min_makers: 1`,
`min_local_judges: 0`, `require_local_yes: false`. When `required_yes` is
not set (in `QuorumPolicy()`, the quorum block, or `TwoKey` with no policy),
it is `min(2, number of judges)`.
`QuorumPolicy.without_diversity_floors()` is **not** that default: it sets the
same floor values but defaults `required_yes` to 2. Prefer `QuorumPolicy()`
(or omit / set `required_yes` to `null`) for the one-judge default threshold.

`profile: high_assurance` in the quorum block, or
`QuorumPolicy.high_assurance()`, needs judges from at least two makers
(`min_makers: 2`), at least one local judge, and a yes from a local judge.
Use it for destructive, irreversible, financial, or external-send tools.
`examples/judges.yaml` meets it with the cloud hooks plus local Qwen. Other
quorum keys still apply on top of the profile. `require_local_yes: true`
with no local judge does not start
(`require_local_yes_without_local_judge`).

A judge's maker is who made the judge's model, as the operator labels it:
the per-judge `maker:` key, or its `provider` when `maker:` is omitted. It
is not verified. It counts only the judges against each other. The
judge-is-not-the-agent check above never compares it with the monitored
agent. Maker names are compared after NFKC and case folding, so
`OpenAI` and `openai` are one maker. `min_distinct_providers` is a separate
count: the `provider` labels of the judges that returned a valid ballot.
Through 0.2.1 these keys were `vendor:` and `min_vendors:`, and 0.2.2 loaded
them as deprecated aliases. 0.2.3 refuses them as unknown keys, and the Python
names `vendor=`, `min_vendors=`, `.vendor`, and `.min_vendors` are gone.

`TwoKey` does not start with no judge, with `timeout_seconds: null` (Path B
needs a hard deadline), or with two judges that share an id
(`duplicate_judge_id`). Judges run in parallel under that deadline; a judge
that errors, abstains, times out, or returns anything but a valid ballot is
not a yes. Ballots are paired with judges by position, and the judge id and
provider on the record come from the judge, not the ballot. A ballot that
names another judge abstains (`judge_id_mismatch`).

Without a local judge, the constitution prose, the action record, and any
attached tool arguments go to the cloud judges' vendors.

`require_path_a_first` stays off unless you set it. `TwoKey.authorize` does
not read it. Both paths still run. After a derive deny, judges do not
receive the argument bytes unless the quorum block sets
`tool_args_on_derive_deny: true`. Other denies still attach non-empty
arguments. `min_distinct_providers` still defaults to 1, so that count is
not itself a floor.

## Local judges

A judge counts as local only when `local_weights` is true and its
`base_url` host is on an explicit allowlist: `localhost`, 127.0.0.0/8,
::1, the RFC 1918 ranges (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16), or IPv6
unique-local fc00::/7. Documentation, benchmark (198.18/15), reserved,
CGNAT (100.64/10), link-local (including 169.254.169.254), and NAT64
(64:ff9b::/96) addresses are not local, even where Python's `is_private`
says so. A DNS name other than `localhost` is not local. Ollama defaults
`local_weights` from the host, so a remote Ollama is not local, and a
model id ending in `:cloud` or `-cloud` (an Ollama cloud model) is cloud
and never local for every judge class, including an OpenAI-compatible
judge pointed at a local Ollama `/v1`, even on loopback. Plain
HTTP to a host other than `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1` is refused
unless the judge sets `allow_insecure_http`. A judge on a LAN address is local for the quorum
floors but not loopback, so it still needs the agent session at call time.

## Parsing and limits

Every JSON and YAML document is parsed strictly: the signed constitution,
the rules file, judges.yaml and agents.yaml (JSON or YAML), the
`monitored_agent:` block, judge ballots, provider responses, agent
proposals, `--args`, and token payloads. A key repeated in one mapping, at
any depth, is refused with `duplicate key '<k>'`; it never resolves
last-one-wins. JSON `NaN` and `Infinity` are refused too (a ballot with
them is malformed and abstains). YAML still loads with a safe loader.

judges.yaml accepts only the top-level keys `judges`, `quorum`, and
`monitored_agent`; agents.yaml only `agents`. Anything else (a typo such as
`quorm`) is refused.

The action claim (the `tool`, `amount_usd`, `data_class`, ... mapping) is
measured before it is read: over 64 KiB of UTF-8 JSON it is denied
(`action_too_large`) and the ledger keeps only `action_size`,
`action_digest`, and `action_omitted: true`. A tool name is an identifier
of at most 128 characters (`a-z`, `0-9`, and `_ . : / -` after case
folding). A `malformed_action:` reason names the field, never its value or
an unknown key's name (`malformed_action:unknown action fields (2)`,
`malformed_action:data_class: not a known class`).

Tool arguments or a proposal over 256 KiB of compact UTF-8 JSON are denied
before anything reads or ledgers them (`args_too_large`, `proposal_too_large`).
The arguments are encoded once: the canonical bytes settle the cap (they are
never shorter than the UTF-8 measure), give the hash the token binds, and are
re-measured exactly only when they are over the cap. The gateway does the same.
The ledger keeps only `tool_args_size`, `tool_args_digest`, and
`tool_args_omitted: true` (or the `proposal_` equivalents). Arguments
nested too deeply to encode are denied in `authorize` and at the gateway
with `invalid_call:tool args are nested too deeply`; the ledger keeps
`tool_args_omitted: true` and `tool_args_error`. Encoding runs before the
size check, so the reason is the same on Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.

Each input (tool args, the action claim, the proposal) is first copied once
into built-in types (`canonical.to_plain`). Any Mapping becomes a dict and a
tuple becomes a list. The size cap, the token's hash, the judges, the ledger
and the tool all read that copy, never a custom type's `str()` or `repr()`.

"Too deeply" means more than 62 levels of objects and arrays
(`canonical.MAX_INPUT_DEPTH`). The encoder itself allows 64
(`canonical.MAX_DEPTH`) and counts without recursion. The two spare levels
are the ones an input gains inside a ledger entry or a judge's record
(`raw.tool_args`), so arguments at exactly 62 still encode there. The
action claim (usually `raw`) and a structured proposal have the same limit.
One level more is `malformed_action:action claim is nested too deeply` or
`malformed_proposal`, and it is ledgered.

If a ledger body still cannot be encoded, `Ledger.append_bounded` writes
the entry anyway. It keeps the body's short scalar fields (reason, jti, tool, allowed), always retains `policy_digest` and `identities_digest` when present, plus `body_size`, `body_digest`, `body_omitted: true`, and `body_error`.

The token lifetime (`TwoKey(ttl_seconds=...)`, `--ttl-seconds`) is an
integer from 1 to 300 seconds; anything else, including a float, NaN, or
infinity, refuses to start (`ttl_out_of_range:`). A token whose time fields
are not finite numbers is `malformed_token`.

### Recommended local judge: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct

`examples/judges.yaml` sets the local judge to `qwen2.5:7b`
(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Apache-2.0, Copyright 2024 Alibaba Cloud). The weights
are not in this repository. Pull them with Ollama, then leave the example
`base_url` as it is:

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b
```

The model card is <https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct>.

## Authorize from the command line

This runs both paths and prints the decision. It does not execute the tool.
Fill in the `model:` lines and the `monitored_agent:` block of
`examples/judges.yaml` first, and set the judge key variables.

```bash
python -m two_key authorize \
  --key ./keys/principal.pem \
  --ledger ./ledger \
  --constitution constitution.signed.json \
  --judges examples/judges.yaml \
  --tool email_draft \
  --args '{"to":"ada@example"}' \
  --proposal "draft a status note" \
  --data-class public \
  --no-irreversible \
  --agent-session-env OPENAI_AGENT_API_KEY \
  --emit-token ./token.txt
```

The bearer token is never printed. The output shows `token_jti` and
`token_digest` (the ledger's `capability_issued.token_hash`).
`--emit-token PATH` writes the token itself to a new file with mode 0600
and refuses to overwrite one. `--agent-session-env NAME` names the
environment variable that holds the agent session; the old
`--agent-session VALUE` took the secret on the command line and is
refused. `--ttl-seconds` sets the token lifetime, 1 to 300 seconds
(default 120). `--args` is parsed strictly before anything else is loaded.
The decision entry records `origin: cli`.

`--data-class` defaults to `classified`, and `--irreversible` defaults to
true. Those are the same fail-closed defaults as a missing field in
`normalize_action`. The command above sets public and reversible so the
example rules allow a draft. `--no-irreversible` is the off switch.

Exit status is 0 on allow and 2 on deny. The ledger records and the head
are ciphertext. The append lock is `<ledger>.lock` next to the ledger
directory. Redemption locks are `<ledger>.redeem-locks/` there too, not
inside the ledger directory. First open writes `<ledger>.ledger-key/ledger.key` and
`<ledger>.witness/witness.pem` next to the ledger directory, not inside it.
Both are created with O_EXCL at mode 0600; a ledger key that is group- or
world-readable, a symlink, or not 32 bytes is refused (`ledger_key_insecure:`
or `ledger_key_unreadable:`). First open also writes the ledger's first entry,
`witness_pinned`; see "Pin the witness key" below.
`--witness-public-key PEM` gives the witness pin kept outside the ledger.
The authorize command does not accept test-double judges.

## Authorize from Python


```python
from pathlib import Path
from two_key.constitution import load_envelope, verify_signed
from two_key.core import TwoKey
from two_key.judges.config import load_config_file
from two_key.identity import load_monitored_agent_file
from two_key.keys import load_private_key_file
from two_key.ledger import Ledger
import os

key = load_private_key_file("keys/principal.pem")
judges, policy = load_config_file(Path("examples/judges.yaml"))
agent = load_monitored_agent_file(Path("examples/judges.yaml"))
ledger = Ledger("ledger", key)
tk = TwoKey.load(ledger, key.public_key(), load_envelope("constitution.signed.json"),
                 judges, private_key=key, quorum=policy, monitored_agent=agent)
decision = tk.authorize(
    {"tool": "email_draft", "amount_usd": 0, "data_class": "public", "irreversible": False},
    {"to": "ada@example"},
    "draft a status note",
    agent_session=os.environ["OPENAI_AGENT_API_KEY"],
)
```

`decision.token` is set only when both paths allow and the signed ledger
head was written. `decision.to_record()` leaves the token out and gives
`token_jti` and `token_digest`, so it is safe to print or log. Any
exception inside `authorize` is a deny (`internal_error:<Type>`) written to
the ledger. The gateway is the only component that should call the tool.

## Monitored agents

`examples/agents.yaml` configures Grok, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and a local
model. Hosting is recorded. It is not trust.

`authorize_from_agent` parses the proposal (`tool`, `arguments`, `proposal`,
and optional structured fields) and runs both paths. It does not call the
tool. Extra keys in the proposal are rejected. Text longer than 1,048,576
characters (four times the arguments cap) is denied `proposal_too_large`
before it is parsed. Text that is not a string, is not JSON, has a repeated
or extra key, or misses a field is denied `malformed_proposal`. Both denies
are ledgered with the text's size and digest only; the reason names no key.

Use a different API key for agents than for judges. Pass the agent object
you run as `TwoKey(monitored_agent=agent)`; it is checked against every
judge at startup like the judges.yaml declaration. A proposal with a
repeated JSON key, at any depth or inside an `arguments` string, is
refused.

## Redeem

```python
from two_key.gateway import ToolGateway
gw = ToolGateway(tk.ledger, tk.issuer.verifier(), tk.compiled, tools={
    "email_draft": lambda args: {"drafted": args["to"]},
})
result = gw.invoke(decision.token, "email_draft", {"to": "ada@example"})
```

Passing `tk.issuer` also works. The constructor keeps a verifier, so
`gw.issuer.private_key` is `None` and `gw.issuer.issue(...)` raises
`verifier_cannot_mint`. The minting key is `<ledger>.capability/capability.pem`,
next to the ledger directory, not inside it. The public half is
`capability.pub.pem` beside it. The key is created once with mode 0600 in a
0700 directory. After a token has been issued it is never regenerated: a
missing or different key refuses to start (`capability_key_missing`,
`capability_key_changed`), and so does a ledger with issued tokens but no
pinned key fingerprint (`capability_key_unpinned`). A capability key equal to the principal key is
refused. The principal key on the ledger signs the head. A token signed
with that principal key does not redeem.

The gateway checks the signature, expiry, a lifetime no longer than the TTL
(`ttl_too_long`), an issue time no more than 5 s ahead
(`issued_in_future`), missing time or binding fields (`malformed_token`),
the tool, argument hash, constitution hashes, spec hash, the recomputed
form, the ledger prefix root, the capability key fingerprint pinned in the
ledger (`capability_key_mismatch`), and that nothing revoked or reloaded
the constitution after issuance. A token that fails its signature or
format check is refused without a ledger entry, so an unauthenticated
caller cannot write to the ledger. Any later refusal of an authenticated
token is ledgered as `gateway_denied` with the reason, the jti, the tool
name (only a short identifier; otherwise its size and digest), and
`tool_args_size` and `tool_args_digest`, never the argument values. Pass the same
argument object you authorized. The hash covers those bytes. The registered
function is called with declared paths only: unnamed keys are omitted, and
a counterparty path is the canonical party. The token is
single-use. A tool exception does not consume it, so the same token can be
retried. There is no content scanner on the way in or out.

Judge auth types are `none`, `env`, `keyring`, `callback`, and `basic`:
`{type: basic, username_env: NAME, password_env: NAME}` reads a username and
password from those two variables and sends them as HTTP Basic, over HTTPS
only (plain HTTP is refused, loopback included). A monitored agent in
agents.yaml takes the same `auth:` types. OAuth device-code auth is
rejected; bring such a token in through `env` or `callback`.

A redemption intent is checkpointed before the tool runs. A crash after that
intent, including after the tool has returned, does not run the token again.
A tool exception appends an abort and leaves the token usable. A crash before
the tool runs also blocks a retry.

### Running the gateway in its own process or host

The intended setup puts the gateway in its own process or on its own host,
next to the tools, with:

- the capability public key only; it never holds the minting key;
- a gateway-only ledger role: it reads the ledger and records
  `redemption_started`, `redemption`, `redemption_aborted`, and
  `gateway_denied`, without the principal private key or the witness
  private key;
- a refresh that sees tokens issued after it opened, without ending
  outstanding tokens;
- a read-only open for audit.

This role is designed, not yet built
([#45](https://github.com/Insomniac-VibeLabs/two-key-concept/issues/45)).
Today `ToolGateway` takes a `Ledger` object; in the `TwoKey` process, pass
`tk.ledger` as above. A `Ledger` opened in another process is its own
in-memory copy: it does not see tokens issued after it opened, so the first
such redemption is refused (`ledger_size_invalid`, then
`ledger_failed: ledger file changed by another writer`) unless the gateway
reopens the ledger before every redemption. Opening a `Ledger` also loads the
witness key and the ledger key, and writing needs the principal private key,
so a gateway process today holds the keys that can sign a ledger head.

## If the ledger will not open after a crash

A process killed between a ledger append and the next checkpoint (the OOM
killer, SIGKILL, power loss) leaves entries the signed head does not cover.
The next open refuses with `signed head does not match the chain`; a torn last
line shows as `ledger record rejected (wrong key or tampered ciphertext)`.
Nothing is lost or forged. Until a recovery command exists
([#49](https://github.com/Insomniac-VibeLabs/two-key-concept/issues/49)),
recover by hand:

1. Stop every process that uses the ledger. Copy the ledger directory and
   its `<ledger>.ledger-key`, `<ledger>.witness`, and `<ledger>.capability`
   siblings somewhere safe.
2. Delete `head.json.tmp` in the ledger directory if it exists.
3. Remove the last line of `entries.jsonl`, then try to open the ledger
   (`Ledger("ledger", key)`). Repeat until it opens. `authorize` writes at
   most six entries before its checkpoint, and the gateway one, so this takes
   at most six tries, or seven with a torn last line. If it still does not
   open, restore the copy and report it.
4. Once it opens, record what you did, for example
   `ledger.append("manual_recovery", {"removed_entries": 3, "reason": "crash before checkpoint"})`
   and then `ledger.checkpoint()`. Keep the copy: the removed lines exist only
   there.

The removed entries were never covered by a signed head. `authorize`
returns a token only after its checkpoint, so no caller holds a token from a
removed entry. The gateway runs a tool only after `redemption_started` is
checkpointed, so a removed `redemption_started` means the tool never ran,
and the token can be redeemed again within its lifetime. A removed
`redemption` or `redemption_aborted` leaves the signed `redemption_started`
in place, so a retry is still refused (`already_attempted`).

## Pin the witness key

The ledger head is signed by the principal key and by the witness key,
`<ledger>.witness/witness.pem`. The witness public key is pinned in two
places.

**In the ledger.** A new ledger's first entry is `witness_pinned`
(`source: new_ledger`). A ledger made by 0.2.2 or earlier pins the key that
signed its current head the first time 0.2.3 opens it (`source: first_use`,
trust on first use), and only if `witness.pem` is that key. Any
`Ledger(...)` or CLI command that opens the ledger does this. From then on,
a head signed by another witness key, or a `witness.pem` that does not
match, is refused with `witness_key_changed:` when the ledger opens, before
an append is written, and at checkpoint.

**Outside the ledger, if you configure it.** Copy
`<ledger>.witness/witness.pub.pem` to a place that whoever writes the ledger
directory and its sibling directories cannot change (another host, a
read-only mount, configuration management), and pass it on every open:

```bash
two-key authorize ... --witness-public-key /etc/two-key/witness.pub.pem
```

```python
from two_key.keys import load_public_key
ledger = Ledger("ledger", key, witness_public_key=load_public_key("/etc/two-key/witness.pub.pem"))
```

With it, a new ledger needs that witness key already in place
(`witness_key_missing:`). What each pin detects:

| Change to the ledger | In-ledger pin only | With the configured pin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `witness.pem` replaced; chain not rewritten | Refused | Refused |
| Head signed by another witness key; chain not rewritten | Refused | Refused |
| Chain rewritten from its first entry with the principal key and the ledger key | Not detected | Refused |
| Witness key swapped before the first open under 0.2.3 | Not detected | Refused, if your copy is the original key |
| Rollback to an earlier head signed by the same keys, or a wipe (#62) | Not detected | Not detected |

Check both pins with:

```bash
two-key audit --key keys/principal.pem --ledger ledger --witness-public-key /etc/two-key/witness.pub.pem
```

It prints `witness.head` (the key that signed the head), `witness.in_ledger`
(the pinned key, the entry that pinned it, and how), `witness.configured`,
and `witness.history`, as `sha256:` fingerprints, plus the
`check_decision_digests` result. It exits 1 on a refusal or a digest
problem. `Ledger.verify()` returns the same `witness` report.

### Rotate the witness key

```bash
two-key rotate-witness --key keys/principal.pem --ledger ledger \
  --witness-public-key /etc/two-key/witness.pub.pem --reason "yearly rotation"
```

or `ledger.rotate_witness(reason="yearly rotation")` in Python. It writes a
`witness_rotated` entry signed by the principal key, the current witness
key, and the new one, signs a new head with the new key, and then moves the
new key into `witness.pem` and its public half into `witness.pub.pem`. Then
copy the new `witness.pub.pem` over your configured copy: the old copy no
longer opens the ledger. Outstanding tokens are not affected.

A rotation needs the old witness key's signature, so a lost witness key
cannot be rotated away from: start a new ledger. Key backup is planned for
0.3.

An interrupted rotation leaves `witness.pem.new` beside `witness.pem`, and
the next rotation refuses until it is dealt with:

- The ledger opens: the rotation never reached the ledger. Delete
  `witness.pem.new`.
- It refuses with `witness_key_changed`: the new head was written, but the
  key was not moved. Move `witness.pem.new` to `witness.pem` (it is already
  mode 0600). The next open rewrites `witness.pub.pem` from it; copy the
  file only after that open.
- It refuses with `signed head does not match the chain`: the
  `witness_rotated` entry was written but not checkpointed. Follow "If the
  ledger will not open after a crash" above, then delete `witness.pem.new`.

## Known trade-offs by configuration

Each line is a trade-off that depends on how you configure Two-Key, and
names the setting or declaration that controls it.

- A credential configured on a judge or an `agents.yaml` agent is read at
  start-up even when its connector never sends it (`auth_header: none`, an
  Ollama agent), so a callback or keyring credential runs then, and one that
  cannot be read refuses to start. At call time it is read only to compare
  with `agent_session`. Remove `auth:` from a connector that does not send
  it.
- A secret that contains `:` is fingerprinted with scrypt at start-up
  (about 0.4 s and 128 MiB each). A host whose OpenSSL has no scrypt (some
  FIPS builds) refuses to start with such a secret
  (`password_fingerprint_failed:`).
- Without `--witness-public-key` (`witness_public_key=`), the principal key
  and the ledger key together can rewrite the ledger under a new witness
  key. With it, the witness key is needed too, and the configured copy must
  be updated after every rotation or the ledger refuses to open.

- Declared `upstream:` labels are folded before match (NFKC, zero-width stripped,
  Unicode dashes to ASCII, casefold). Bare maker names such as `openai` map to the
  maker's API host (`api.openai.com`).
- Omit `tenant` when there is none; an empty mapping `tenant: {}` is refused.
- A judge with the agent's credential is refused at any address. Two
  local servers that both ignore their key and share a placeholder value are
  refused too; give each its own value, or leave it off one side
  (`auth: {type: none}` on a judge, `credential: none` on the agent).
- Two-Key cannot tell whether a server checks keys. Two sides with
  different placeholders on one server that ignores them start, with no
  warning, though the server cannot tell them apart.
- Two keyless sides on one address are refused whatever their models. Run
  the judge on another daemon or port, or give one side a credential.
  Addresses are compared as configured and DNS is not resolved, so two names
  for one keyless server count as two addresses.
- Declared `upstream:` and `tenant:` values are trusted as declared, not
  verified. They only change which warnings print, so a false declaration
  can hide a warning; it cannot let a judge with the agent's credential
  start.
- A maker prefix in a model id (`mistral/gpt-4o`) names the maker, not the
  host that serves it. On a host that is not a recognized vendor, router,
  or inference host (or any local alias), the same model as the agent
  starts with a `same_model_unknown_proxy` warning unless that side declares
  an `upstream:`.
- A local daemon serving its own weights warns against the same model until
  you declare its own address (`upstream: localhost:11434`).
- A private-address `base_url` (RFC 1918, fc00::/7) is treated as a local
  proxy, so it warns when it serves the agent's model without `upstream:`.
- This machine's own addresses are read once per process. After an address
  change, restart before relying on how `base_url` hosts fold to `localhost`.
- A `tenant:` on a proxy is scoped by the provider family its `upstream:`
  reaches, not by the proxy's address.
- `allow_same_model_distinct_tenant` and `allow_same_provider_judge` are
  deprecated no-ops: accepted, recorded in `quorum_policy` (so part of
  `policy_digest`), and announced on stderr.
- A judge and the agent on the same address and model with different
  credentials start, with a `same_model_same_address` warning.
- The runtime agent is not matched against `monitored_agent:`. The
  declaration is what is compared. At call time `agent_session` is compared
  with each judge's credential, at any address; it is not compared with the
  declared agent credential and is not ledgered.
- `agents.yaml` does not accept `tenant:` or `upstream:`. For an agent
  behind a proxy, declare it with the `monitored_agent:` block or an
  `AgentDeclaration`, which do.
- After a successful `gateway_denied` append for a given jti, further denies of that authenticated token still refuse but do not append another `gateway_denied`. The jti is remembered only after append+checkpoint succeed (so a failed ledger write can be retried); the in-memory set is LRU-capped (default 4096; `max_denied_jtis` is clamped to at least 1). Concurrent same-jti denies are single-flight: only one append runs at a time; waiters re-check and skip if already marked. Waiters use a timed wait (default 30 seconds; `deny_inflight_wait_seconds` on `ToolGateway` must be finite and positive — `inf`/`nan`/≤0 fall back to 30s): on timeout they still deny fail-closed without marking and without fail-open, so a stuck ledger append cannot hang waiters forever. `ttl_seconds` still bounds how long a token can be presented.
- The gateway pins the capability key from the latest
  `constitution_loaded`. Neither a reload nor `revoke` changes the pinned key:
  a missing or different key is refused, and only a new ledger pins a new one.
- `payload:` paths in a tool spec may overlap each other. Only overlap
  with control paths is refused.
- `dropped_keys` is checked against every declared path, so the cost grows
  with the size of a tool spec.
- `model:` ids are not length-capped before they are normalized. Keep them
  to real model names.
- `authorize(..., agent_id=, hosting=, origin=)` and `authorize_from_agent`
  treat those fields as operator/library metadata for the ledger, not
  agent-controlled claims. Each must be a `str` or omitted (`None`); after
  strip, longer than 256 characters is refused (`agent_metadata_too_large`).
  Non-str is `invalid_agent_metadata` (ledger `got: non_str`, never the raw
  type name). A non-Mapping `agent_meta` (`check_agent_meta_mapping`) is
  `invalid_agent_metadata` with `got: non_mapping` (field values stay
  `non_str`). The value is never ledgered on deny. Blank/`None` `origin`
  defaults to `library`. An agent process can still pass huge values into
  `authorize()`, which is why the cap exists. If a ledger body cannot be
  encoded on a path about to issue a token, the decision is
  `ledger_body_too_large` (fail closed).
- Quorum/judge ledger exception text and both Path A `vm_fault` paths (`VMFault` and generic `Exception`) are `type_tag: message` capped at 300 characters; oversize keeps a prefix plus a digest of the remainder (`exception_ledger_error` / `cap_ledger_text`). All `ledger_failed:` reason strings for a `LedgerError` (gateway `_record_deny`, gateway redemption, core authorize/`_deny`) cap the message the same way; non-`LedgerError` deny paths keep `type_tag` only. Canonical encoding refuses a non-JSON type with the fixed label `unsupported_type` (never raw `__name__`); authorize/gateway `invalid_call:` / `malformed_action:` suffixes from `EncodingError` also go through `cap_ledger_text`. Derive `value_unreadable:` uses `type_tag`; `derive_failed:` reasons are `cap_ledger_text`'d where stored. Ledger `omitted_body` JSON default writes `<type_tag>` for non-JSON values. LLM judge `transport:` / `malformed_response:` abstain errors use `type_tag`.
- A token's `iat`/`exp` are read with `float()`. Tokens minted here are
  always numeric, so this only matters for tokens from another issuer.
- Config errors from the CLI print a traceback. Check judges.yaml with a
  dry start.
- A `ttl_seconds` out of range is reported with the prefix
  `ttl_out_of_range:`.
- On Python 3.12, an agent reply nested past 62 levels parses and is
  `invalid_call`. On 3.10 and 3.11 it is `malformed_proposal`. Both deny.
- `agent_session` is the frozen session. The agent's key is not added to it.
- The ledger's own records are read with the standard JSON parser, not the
  strict one, because they are signed and hash-chained.
- `audit.check_decision_digests` on a ledger from before 0.2.0 reports the
  missing digests as mismatches. Start a new ledger, or read those as "pre-0.2.0".

Open items that no setting changes:
- Test gaps: the ledger's O_EXCL path, the case-folded control-path check,
  the audit self-check, and five bare `assertRaises`.
- Each redemption leaves one empty lock file per jti under
  `<ledger>.redeem-locks/`. Nothing deletes them, because removing a file
  another process holds a `flock` on is unsafe. The gateway's in-memory
  per-jti lock is removed once no thread holds or waits on it.
- Comments that still cite design notes not in the repository.

## Revoke outstanding tokens

```python
tk.revoke("principal stop")
```

This ends every token issued before the call: the gateway refuses them
(`revoked_or_reloaded`). It is not a kill switch:

- It does not stop new approvals. The same `TwoKey` keeps running both paths,
  and a token issued after the revoke redeems normally.
- It does not survive a restart. Any new `TwoKey` writes a fresh
  `constitution_loaded` entry, which also ends every token issued before it,
  and then approves calls as usual.

To stop an agent, stop calling `authorize` (or stop the process), and revoke
to end tokens already issued. A persistent halt that refuses new approvals
until a ledgered resume is not built.
