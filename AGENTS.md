# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working in this clone of
[Insomniac-VibeLabs/two-key-concept](https://github.com/Insomniac-VibeLabs/two-key-concept).

This file is a short contributor guide for agents. Product and API context for
any LLM reader is in [llms.txt](llms.txt). Do not replace one with the other.

## Scope

Concept line only: signed constitution, Path A bytecode, Path B judge hooks,
monitored-agent hooks, encrypted ledger, single-use capability token, and a
verify-only gateway. Prototype. Apache-2.0.

Do **not** add a scanning or antivirus engine, chain anchoring, or seed
phrases here. The items in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) are in scope: key backup,
ledger export for a SIEM, DLP and antivirus hooks that call external scanners,
an MCP adapter, PKI with certificate recovery, hybrid ML-DSA signatures, a FIPS
approved mode, and a local GUI. Build them in the order and with the limits stated there, unless the
operator says otherwise. See [docs/SCOPE.md](docs/SCOPE.md).

## Branch and commit rules

- Package 0.2.2 is tag `v0.2.2` on `main` and `working`. Do not move `v0.2.0`
  (`2f756ac`). `v0.1.12` and `v0.1.6` stay on their trees.
- Do not push, force-push, or open PRs unless the operator asks.
- Never commit keys, ledgers, or credentials.
- Update `CHANGES.md` with every commit. Read
  `CHANGES.md` "Upgrading from 0.1.12" before changing 0.2.0 config shapes.

## Install and version matrix

Requires Python ≥ 3.10. Package name `two-key-concept`, import name `two_key`,
version `0.2.2`, tag `v0.2.2`. Not on PyPI.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[yaml]"
python -m unittest discover -s tests
python -m two_key demo
```

| Extra | Provides | When needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (none) | `cryptography>=41` | Ed25519, SHA-256, AES-256-GCM ledger |
| `yaml` | PyYAML | `.yaml` rules and judge configs |

Git install:  
`pip install "two-key-concept[yaml] @ git+https://github.com/Insomniac-VibeLabs/two-key-concept.git@v0.2.2"`

## Tests and docs

- Tests: `python -m unittest discover -s tests` (no network). Keep the suite
  network-free; use `two_key.testing` doubles only where the docs allow.
- When a claim changes, update `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `docs/HOWTO.md`,
  `docs/FIT.md`, `docs/COMPARISON.md`, `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`,
  `docs/SCOPE.md`, `CHANGES.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`, and `llms.txt` as needed.
- When a roadmap item ships, update `docs/SCOPE.md` and `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`
  in the same release.
- Keep [docs/HOWTO.md](docs/HOWTO.md) "Known trade-offs by configuration"
  accurate when a config trade-off changes.

## Crypto and security changes

Crypto here is Ed25519 and SHA-256 via `cryptography`, plus AES-256-GCM for
ledger ciphertext. The ledger key, witness key, and capability private key
live outside the ledger directory. The gateway must verify only; it must not
mint.

Before changing authorization, tokens, the gateway, the ledger, or judge ≠
agent identity checks: get a security review from the maintainer. While this is
a prototype, report security findings as public issues, per
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Fail-closed defaults to preserve

- A missing ballot is not a yes.
- Both paths run once the call is well-formed and within limits.
- `authorize_from_agent` does not execute a tool.
- `require_path_a_first` is not a skip.
- JSON/YAML inputs refuse duplicate keys. Oversized or malformed calls deny
  before either path.
- Default quorum needs one judge and has no diversity floors;
  `QuorumPolicy.high_assurance` / `profile: high_assurance` adds judges from
  two makers (`min_makers`), one local judge, and a local yes.
- `tool_specs` is required. A disagreeing claim is a deny.
- No judge may be the monitored agent: a judge holding the agent's
  credential (the same API token, or the same username and password) is
  refused at any address, whether or not either side sends it; so are two
  sides that send no credential on one address. Other overlaps warn
  and are recorded. Addresses are compared as configured, without DNS.
- The ledger's witness public key is pinned: a head or `witness.pem` that
  does not match the pin in the ledger, or the configured
  `witness_public_key`, is refused. It changes only by `rotate_witness`.
- The gateway verifies only; it never mints.
