"""Path B judge interface (engineering; the protocol follows spec 5.4).

A judge receives the principal's natural-language constitution, the
normalized action record, and the proposal text. It returns a structured
ballot. Implementations must never raise into the quorum: any failure is
reported as an ``abstain`` ballot with ``error`` set, and abstentions never
count toward "yes" (fail closed).

Quorum protocol specifics (the section-4 profile). The prior-art memo is
not in this repository. The decision record is CONCEPTION_NOTES.md Entry 2
in Insomniac-VibeLabs/two-key:
* ``vendor`` and ``local_weights`` describe the judge so that the judge set
  can be checked for vendor heterogeneity (quorum.check_judge_set);
* ballots are bound to H(action record) and H(constitution). The convenor
  passes a ``binding`` mapping to ``score_bound``. A judge that reports hashes
  (echo) is checked against it; the convenor stamps the hashes on every ballot.
  See quorum.py.
