"""
Two-Key: Path B, the multi-model intent quorum
=====================================================
N judges, each connected to whichever AI the principal chooses, vote on
whether a proposal is consistent with the principal's natural-language
constitution (spec 5.4). The convenor counts booleans. It never averages prose.

Fixes from the original prototype (see CHANGES.md):
- An exact integer k-of-n threshold (``required_yes``) replaces the
  fractional threshold. With the old 0.67 default, 2-of-3 failed.
- A minimum number of responding judges (``min_responding``, spec 5.4 "K").
  Zero judges, or too few valid responses, is a deny.
- A judge that raises, or returns a malformed ballot, is an abstention and
  never counts as "yes".
- ``min_distinct_providers`` counts providers among responding ballots.
  It still defaults to 1, so that check is not a floor by itself.
- The default needs one judge: ``min_vendors=1``, ``min_local_judges=0``,
  ``require_local_yes=False``. The owner's rule is at least one judge, and
  that judge must not be the monitored agent. The diversity floors are
  opt-in: ``QuorumPolicy.high_assurance()`` (or ``profile: high_assurance``
  in judges.yaml) sets at least two vendors, at least one local judge, and a
  yes from a local judge (``require_local_yes``). It is recommended for
  destructive, irreversible, financial, or external-send tools.
  ``require_local_yes`` with no local judge in the set is a configuration
  error at start-up and a deny in ``convene``.
  ``QuorumPolicy.without_diversity_floors`` still works and now builds the
  default. ``require_path_a_first`` is not part of the floor and is not a
  skip.
- Judges run in parallel (one thread per judge) under an overall deadline
  ``timeout_seconds`` (default 45 s). A judge that has not answered by the
  deadline is recorded as an abstention (``error="timeout..."``), so a slow or
  hung provider can never produce a "yes" and cannot stall Two-Key beyond
  the deadline. ``TwoKey`` and the judges.yaml loader refuse
  ``timeout_seconds=None``, so a deployment always has a hard deadline. Per-request
  HTTP timeouts are still set on each LLM judge.

Quorum protocol specifics. The prior-art memo is not stored in this
repository or in two-key. The decision record is CONCEPTION_NOTES.md
Entry 2 in Insomniac-VibeLabs/two-key:
- Vendor heterogeneity: ``check_judge_set`` runs when ``TwoKey`` starts, and
  again inside ``convene``. The default floor is one vendor and no local
  judge. ``QuorumPolicy.high_assurance`` is >= 2 vendors, >= 1 local judge,
  and ``require_local_yes``. ``QuorumPolicy.section4`` is that floor plus
  ``require_path_a_first``, which ``TwoKey.authorize`` still does not read.
  With ``heterogeneity_scope="responding"`` the same floor also applies to the
  judges that actually returned valid ballots.
- Availability floor K (``min_responding``) distinct from the approval
  threshold T (``required_yes``): fewer than K valid ballots is a deny
  *without counting*. The result then has ``counted=False`` and no yes/no
  tally (yes/no are None).
- Ballots are bound to H(action record) and H(constitution), plus the two
  compilation hashes (nl_hash, bytecode_hash; §4 (ii)). The convenor stamps
  the binding on every ballot. A judge that reports hashes that differ is an
  abstention (``binding_mismatch``). With ``ballot_binding="echo"`` a yes/no
  ballot that the judge itself did not bind is an abstention too. Malformed
  ballots are abstentions, which count as deny.
- Judge inputs: ``judge_inputs="record_only"`` (default) gives judges only the
  normalized action record and the constitution, never the agent's proposal
  text (transcript) or tool outputs. "record_and_proposal" restores the
  earlier behaviour. After a derive deny, ``tool_args`` is omitted unless
  ``tool_args_on_derive_deny`` is set. Path B still runs.
- Both paths run once the call is well-formed and within limits. A Path A deny does not skip Path B.
  ``require_path_a_first`` is stored on the policy and copied into
  ``to_record``. ``TwoKey.authorize`` does not read it. There is no
  ``short_circuit_path_b`` setting in this package.
