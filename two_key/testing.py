"""Offline TEST DOUBLES only. They are not real judges.

``HeuristicJudge`` is the original prototype's keyword heuristic. It is kept
only so the demo and tests run without network access. Unlike a real judge it
does not consult the constitution meaningfully, so never use it in
deployment. ``core.TwoKey`` refuses test doubles unless
``allow_test_doubles=True``.
