Two-Key: a Path B judge must not be the monitored agent
=======================================================
The rule (the owner's, revised 2026-10-08, restated 2026-10-09): at least one
judge, and no judge may be the monitored agent. A judge may run any model from
any vendor. A judge must not be the monitored agent: ``TwoKey`` refuses to start
(``judge_matches_agent:``) when a judge holds the monitored agent's credential
(the same API token, or the same username and password), at any address: a
credential identifies its holder, so the address it is sent to does not matter.
That holds whether or not either side sends the credential (a judge with
``auth_header: none``, an ``agents.yaml`` Ollama agent) and whichever form it is
held in (a token ``user:pass`` and a Basic pair ``user`` / ``pass`` are the same
username and password). Two sides that send no credential have only their
address to tell them apart, so they are refused on the same address. The
operator configures who the agent is; Two-Key refuses a judge that is the agent
and makes likely accidents visible.

The agent's identity comes only from operator configuration
(``TwoKey(monitored_agent=...)``, the ``monitored_agent:`` block of
judges.yaml, and any configured ``agents``), never from anything the agent
says about itself. The declaration names the model, the provider (recorded as
a label, never compared), the endpoint ``base_url``, the credential (the
name of the environment variable that holds the agent's key,
``credential_env``; the two variables that hold a username and password,
``username_env`` and ``password_env``, sent as HTTP Basic over HTTPS only; or
``credential: none`` for a keyless loopback or private-address agent), and optionally a
``tenant`` mapping (see below). If any required field is missing or cannot
be read, Two-Key refuses to start.

Each judge and agent is resolved to:

- ``model``: the model id, normalized (case, router prefixes such as
  ``openai/`` or Bedrock's ``anthropic.``, dated snapshot suffixes such as
  ``-2024-08-06`` or ``-20241022``, ``-latest``, Vertex ``@`` versions,
  Bedrock ``-v2:0``, Ollama ``:latest``, and a few known aliases). The id is
  NFKC-normalized first, Unicode dashes are folded to ``-``, and zero-width
  characters are removed, so ``gpt\u20104o`` and fullwidth ``gpt-4o`` equal
  ``gpt-4o``.
- ``endpoint``: the normalized ``host:port`` of ``base_url`` (lower case,
  default port filled in, every alias of this machine written ``localhost``:
  loopback names and addresses in any spelling such as ``127.1``,
  ``localhost.localdomain``, ``0.0.0.0``/``::``, and the machine's own names
  and addresses). Other hosts are compared literally.
- ``upstreams``: who really serves or made the model, as upstream hosts.
  A direct provider host is itself (``api.openai.com``). A recognized router
  (OpenRouter, Azure OpenAI and Azure AI, Bedrock, Vertex, Cloudflare AI
  Gateway, Portkey) or a ``provider/model`` id (LiteLLM style) resolves to the
  model maker's API host, or ``maker:<name>`` for a maker without one. A
  loopback or private host is itself. An unrecognized host or router that
  cannot be resolved from the model id stays **unresolved**. Upstream labels
  are normalized (``host`` or ``host:port``, default port removed). A shared
  maker upstream is not compared; the same *model* reaching the same route
  is warned (see ``routes``).
- ``routes``: where the model is actually served, for the same-model warning:
  the endpoint, every declared ``upstream:``, and ``ollama.com`` for an Ollama
  cloud model.
- ``tenant``: account ids, each scoped by provider family, from what the
  base_url shows plus what the operator declares under ``tenant:``
  (keys ``organization``, ``project``, ``account``, ``deployment``):
  Azure resource (host) and deployment (``/openai/deployments/<name>``),
  Vertex project (``/projects/<id>/`` in the path, or declared ``project``),
  Bedrock ``account`` (declared) with the region from the host, OpenAI
  ``organization`` / ``project`` (declared). Elsewhere a declared id is scoped
  by provider family: the endpoint's, or for a proxy (local or unrecognized
  host) the family of its declared upstream, its Ollama cloud model, or its
  model maker, never the proxy's address.
- ``credential``: a fingerprint of every credential the side holds, sent or
  not, with leading and trailing whitespace stripped. An API token is
  fingerprinted with HMAC-SHA256 (``hmac-sha256:...``); a username and
  password, as one ``username:password`` pair, with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
  (``pbkdf2-sha256-600000:...``, 600,000 iterations), because a password may
  be guessable. Any secret that contains ``:`` is fingerprinted as a pair, so a
  username and password match whether a side holds them as HTTP Basic or as
  a ``user:pass`` token. ``credential_sent`` records whether the connector
  sends it. Both are keyed
  by a random per-install secret, ``fingerprint.key`` beside the ledger key
  (``<ledger>.ledger-key/``, created once with O_EXCL, mode 0600). That key
  stops someone who sees a fingerprint outside the key directory (a copied
  record, an export) from testing guesses. It does not stop someone who holds
  the key directory, who can also decrypt the ledger: there a random API
  token is safe by its length, and a password only by PBKDF2's cost. Raw
  keys and passwords are never stored or logged. ``none`` means the endpoint
  takes no key.

Refusals, judge against agent, message prefix ``judge_matches_agent:``:

- the same credential fingerprint, at any address: an API token, a
  username/password pair, or any credential the agent declares. Every
  credential each side holds is compared, sent or not. A
  placeholder value that a local server ignores (``EMPTY``) counts too: give
  each side its own value, or leave it off one side (``auth: {type: none}``
  on a judge, ``credential: none`` on the agent);
- the same address (normalized ``endpoint``, ``host:port``, every alias of
  this machine folded to ``localhost``) with no credential sent on either
  side: Two-Key has nothing to tell them apart by.

Two-Key also refuses to start, with its own message, when a judge's or the
agent's address or credential cannot be read at start-up.

Everything else is allowed: any model, any vendor, any endpoint. Likely
accidents are allowed with a warning on stderr, and every warning is
recorded in ``constitution_loaded`` (``judge_agent_separation.warnings``):
one side without a credential on the same address, the same model on the
same address, the same model through a shared route or through a local or
unrecognized proxy with no declared ``upstream:``, a shared tenant id, and an
identity whose upstream cannot be resolved. Addresses are compared as
configured; DNS names are not resolved.

``allow_same_model_distinct_tenant`` and ``allow_same_provider_judge`` are
deprecated no-ops: nothing they used to lift is refused any more.

The runtime check stays as a second layer: a judge whose credential equals
the frozen agent session abstains with ``cloud_judge_reused_agent_session``,
wherever it connects.
