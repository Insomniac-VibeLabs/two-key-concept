"""Recompute the digests a decision entry carries and check them against ``constitution_loaded``.

Each ``constitution_loaded`` entry holds the resolved judge and agent identities
(``judge_agent_separation``) and the full quorum policy (``quorum_policy``), with
their digests. Each later ``decision`` entry carries only ``identities_digest`` and
``policy_digest``. ``check_decision_digests`` recomputes both from the latest
``constitution_loaded`` before each decision and reports any mismatch::

    from two_key.audit import check_decision_digests
    problems = check_decision_digests(ledger)   # [] when every digest matches

The recipe by hand: ``identities_digest`` is ``canonical_hash({"agents": sep["agents"],
"judges": sep["judges"]})`` and ``policy_digest`` is ``canonical_hash(quorum_policy)``,
where ``canonical_hash`` is SHA-256 of sorted-key, compact, ASCII JSON (two_key.canonical).

``witness_pins`` lists the ledger's witness pin entries (``witness_pinned`` and ``witness_rotated``); the last
one names the witness key pinned now. ``Ledger.verify()`` returns it with the out-of-ledger pin and the key
that signed the head (``Ledger.witness_report``).
