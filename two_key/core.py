"""Two-Key concept: a tool call runs only if Path A and Path B both allow.

``authorize_from_agent`` runs both paths once the call is well-formed and within limits,
and does not execute tools. A malformed or oversized call is an early deny before either path.
Hosting (local or cloud) is recorded and never treated as trust.

``TwoKey`` refuses to start (``TwoKeyConfigError``) with no judge, with no
Path B deadline, with duplicate judge ids, without an operator declaration
of the monitored agent (``monitored_agent_required:``), or when a judge
holds the monitored agent's credential (the same API token, or the same
username and password) at any address, sent or not, or when neither side
sends a credential on one address (``judge_matches_agent:``; see identity.py).
