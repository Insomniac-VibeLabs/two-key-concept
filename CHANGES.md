# Changes

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-02

Initial concept repository, private, Apache-2.0.

Taken from `Insomniac-VibeLabs/two-key` branch `10.2.2026` (`b9e588e`) as the
reference, then cut down to the initial two-key:

- signed constitution, Path A policy VM, Path B judge quorum
- hash-chained ledger with a signed head and Merkle root bound into the token
- single-use gateway redemption
- judge transport kept: no SDK, no streaming, connection reuse, no redirects,
  one HTTP 400 fallback that drops schema / cache / reasoning knobs
- monitored-agent hooks kept: agents are untrusted regardless of host;
  `authorize_from_agent` always runs both paths and does not execute tools

Not included: scanning, antivirus, DLP, PKI, anchoring, seed phrases, ledger
encryption, hybrid ML-DSA.

Engineering note, not a conception entry. The dated conception record stays
in the `two-key` repository.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-10-02

On branch `10.2.2026`. `prev` and `main` stay at 0.1.0.

- Gateway runs the tool before redemption. A tool exception leaves the token redeemable.
- Merkle root is RFC 6962. Odd counts no longer duplicate the last leaf.
- Username/password and OAuth device-code auth are rejected.
- Ledger entries and head are AES-256-GCM. Head is signed by the principal and a witness key.
- `two-key authorize` runs both paths and does not execute the tool.
- CodeQL workflow added so code scanning can run on this private repo.

## 0.1.2 — 2026-10-02

Private concept package. Not published to PyPI. Tag `v0.1.2`.

- Ledger key and witness key are created outside the ledger directory. The principal key neither decrypts the log nor signs a head alone.
- `authorize` no longer accepts `--allow-test-doubles`.
- Tests cover a second-process reload and a missing witness key.
- Bandit workflow added. CodeQL remains for when Advanced Security is enabled.
- Crash-after-success redemption window stays documented and unchanged.

## Docs — 2026-10-02

Clarified the GitHub file list. The middle column is the last commit message,
not a description of each file. README no longer calls the package private.
Added `llms.txt` and repository topics for discovery. No behavior change.

## 0.1.3 — 2026-10-02

- Redemption writes and checkpoints an intent before the tool runs. A retry of that intent does not run the tool.
- A tool exception appends an abort and leaves the token usable.
- A crash after the intent and before the tool runs also blocks a retry.

## 0.1.4 — 2026-10-03

Tag `v0.1.4`. No behavior change. The `v0.1.3` tag stays on the earlier tree.

- README architecture diagram: a monitored agent only proposes, Path B judges vote with their own credentials, and the token is returned to the caller. Path B still runs when Path A denies.
